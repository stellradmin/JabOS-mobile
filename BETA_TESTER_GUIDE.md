## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data safe during beta testing?**
A: Yes! We use bank-level encryption for all data. Your birth chart, messages, and personal info are fully secure. We also use Persona for identity verification, which is SOC 2 Type II certified.

**Q: Will I keep my account after beta?**
A: Yes! Your profile, matches, and messages will carry over to the public launch. We won't reset your data unless absolutely necessary (and we'll notify you first).

**Q: Can I invite my friends to beta?**
A: Not during the initial 2-week period. We're starting with a small group (10-20 testers). After the beta, we'll open up to more users.

**Q: What if I can't finish testing?**
A: No worries! Life happens. Just let us know if you need to drop out. We appreciate any time you can give.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does the app need my location?**
A: Location is used **only** to generate your birth chart. We don't track your real-time location or share it with anyone.

**Q: Why do I need to verify my identity?**
A: Safety first! Persona verification helps us ensure everyone on Stellr is a real person, reducing fake profiles and scams.

**Q: Can I use Stellr on Android?**
A: Not yet! We're starting with iOS for beta. Android support is planned for a future update.

**Q: Why does TestFlight say "Beta Expired"?**
A: Betas have 90-day limits. We'll send updated builds regularly. Just install the latest version from TestFlight.

**Q: The app is crashing - what do I do?**
A: First, try force-closing the app and reopening it. If it keeps crashing, delete and reinstall from TestFlight. Then report the bug so we can fix it.

### Feature Questions

**Q: How are matches calculated?**
A: Our algorithm looks at:
- Sun, Moon, and Rising sign compatibility
- Venus and Mars placements
- Synastry aspects between birth charts
- Your questionnaire responses

**Q: Why do I only get 5 invites per day?**
A: This simulates the free tier experience. We want to test the paywall flow. Premium users (post-launch) will get 20+ invites daily.

**Q: Can I change my birth information after signing up?**
A: Not during beta. This feature is coming post-launch. If you entered incorrect info, let us know and we can help.

**Q: What happens if I match with another beta tester?**
A: Great! You can chat with them just like a real match. In fact, we encourage beta testers to match with each other to test the messaging system.
